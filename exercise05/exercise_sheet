IMPORTANT: Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s work, words, code or ideas as if
           they were your own. Plagiarism is a serious offense and will not be
           tolerated. You must also cite any sources from which your code or any
           ideas come from. Give proper credit while adding your own reflection
           will likely earn you higher scores.
           You may include citations as comments in the code block where the idea
           is used or as a footnote in non-code exercises.

You learn how to plot math functions, handle string operations and create a simple GUI in
in this exercise. (12 marks)

1) Use matplotlib.pyplot.plot to produce a plot of the functions f(x) = EXP(−x/10) sin(PI.x)
   and g(x) = x.EXP(−x/3) over the interval [0, 10]. Include labels for the x and y-axes,
   and a legend showing which line is which plot. Save the plot as a .jpg file in the folder.

2) Write a function named compute_time that takes in two required parameters in string format:
     - a start time in the 24-hour time format
     - duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes

   The function adds the duration time to the start time and returns the new time as result.
   If the new time is one or more days later, the function should return the new time followed
   by "x days later" where x is the number of days.
   For example:

        compute_time("14:02", "24:30")
        #returns "15:32, 1 day later"

   Do not import any Python libraries. Assume the program will always be fed with valid start times,
   and the minutes in the duration will always be a whole number less than 60.

   Write your code in the file calculate_time.py. During development, you may use main.py to test
   the compute_time() function simply by clicking "Run" in your IDE.

3) Using the rgb_to_ycbcr converter method from exercise_04, implement a simple GUI which displays the
   colour space transformed image for sample_image.jpg.
   You may use tkinter or any other GUI libraries in python.
