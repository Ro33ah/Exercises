IMPORTANT: Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s work, words, code or ideas as if
           they were your own. Plagiarism is a serious offense and will not be
           tolerated. You must also cite any sources from which your code or any
           ideas come from. Give proper credit while adding your own reflection
           will likely earn you higher scores.
           You may include citations as comments in the code block where the idea
           is used or as a footnote in non-code exercises.

This exercise touches on image processing and lambda functions (7 marks)

1) Research the color model YCbCr on the Internet.
    a) Describe this color model briefly.

    b) Give a formula, which can be used to calculate the RGB value of a pixel
    (for color values from the interval {0,...,255}in N) into the corresponding
    YCbCr values.

    c) Write a Python method, which implements the conversion in b). Input and output should
     be lists of length 3.

2) Implement function lambda_version in the_solutions.py which does the same thing as the
   change_list function in the same file.
   Hint: Python's built-in map function would be very useful here.

3) In numpy library, the random.rand function can be used to construct and fill vectors and
   matrices with random numbers. Using the help facility in Python to construct a 10 × 10 matrix
   M and fill with random numbers.
