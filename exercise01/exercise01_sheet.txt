1) Max Mustermann gives the following algorithm to calculate the factorial
   of a number n:
    for input n in N:
        c <-- 1
        for i <-- 1,...,n repeat
            c <-- c.i
        output c

   Max is very surprised that he does not get the full score for his solution.
   Find his mistake and correct it.

2) The following algorithm checks whether an entered natural number
   n is a prime number
    For input n in N:
        if n mod i = 0 then
            Output "n is not a prime number"
            End Algorithm
    Output "n is a prime number"

   a) Explain why this algorithm correctly determines whether n is a prime number
   b) The given algorithm passes through the loop n twice. Show how this procedure
   can be significantly sped up. Justify your answer.


3) A farmer arrives with his goat, a huge cabbage and a wolf at the bank of a river
   with no bridges. (Why a farmer has a wolf with him is a different matter altogether).
   At the river is a boat with which he can transport a maximum of one of the items at once
   (goat or cabbage or wolf). However, the appetite of the animals suggest that the wolf
   would eat the goat or the goat would eat the cabbage if the farmer is not present.
   In this dilemma, the farmer needs to find a way to transport all three objects safely to the
   other side of the shore.

   a) Give the farmer an algorithm (in modern notation)to solve his problem. The algorithm should only generate steps
      in the following form as output:
        - Bring x to the left/right bank. (where x is either the goat, the wolf or the cabbage).
        - Drive to the left/right shore without an additional passenger.
      How often does the farmer go back and forth?
   b) Would it be faster if the farmer found a larger boat, which in addition to the farmer could
      transport two items?
   c) What does the algorithm look like if in scenario (b) the farmer has, in addition, a bear with him
      who eats anything left alone? How often does the farmer go back and forth now?
