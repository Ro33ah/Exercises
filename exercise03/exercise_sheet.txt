In this exercise, you will implement your first class, work with strings, practice
file handling and working with graphics in Python. As usual, automated tests have
been provided to aid testing.

1) Implement a Stack class in stack.py with the init, pop, push and peek methods.
   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type) for more details
   on stack abstract data structures

2) Write the function in max_sum_subarray.py which takes as required arguments an
   array of integers and a number, finds the maximum sum of a sub-array with length
   equal to the number passed to the function. A sub-array must consecutive elements
   of the original array. For example, if array = [6, 9, 23, 60, 2, 0] and length = 3, [23, 60, 2] is
   a sub-array while [9, 2, 0] is not.

3) Write a Student class with full name attribute and keeps exam scores for the
   following subjects: Math, English, History, Biology and Geography. It should
   include methods to calculate individual average score, assigns a grade attribute
   to the student instance based on the average score as well as compute the average
   score for all students per subject.

4) In the text file is a record of students and their corresponding scores in the
   above subjects.
   Write a function which imports the data from the file and for each student, computes
   the final grade and writes each student name and grade to a text file.


read from file, perform some computation (and maybe write output to file)
Grade calculator:
import Data from txt file
implement individual_average
implement class_average
implement percentage
assign grade
