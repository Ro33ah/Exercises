IMPORTANT: Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s work, words, code or ideas as if
           they were your own. Plagiarism is a serious offense and will not be
           tolerated. You must also cite any sources from which your code or any
           ideas come from. Give proper credit while adding your own reflection
           will likely earn you higher scores.
           You may include citations as comments in the code block where the idea
           is used or as a footnote in non-code exercises.

The purpose of this exercise is to understand conditionals. (10 marks)

1) Hannes is a well sought after engineer and has several job offers.
   He must choose on and he has some preferences. He likes his life in Weimar
   and would take a job there if he earned over 50,000 a year. He'd only work in
   Berlin if it pays at least 100,000. Anywhere else, he is fine with 70,000 a year,
   unless it's with the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in which case,
   he would work for free.

   The following code represents his basic strategy for accepting a job offer.

        pay = n
        offer = ""
        if offer == "DLR":"
            print "Yassss!!! I’ll take it!"
        elif offer == "Berlin":
            if pay < 100000:
                print "Nein, Danke"
            else:
                print "I’ll take it!"
        elif offer == "Weimar" and pay > 50000:
            print "I’ll take it!"
        elif pay > 60000:
            print "I’ll take it!"
        else:
            print "I can do better."

   a) What would be the output for each of the following offers?
      i) offer = "Zeppelin GmbH Weimar"
         pay = 60000
      ii) offer = "BAUER Berlin"
          pay = 93000
      iii) offer = "DLR Köln"
           pay = 23000
      iv) offer = "GOLDBECK GmbH Hamburg"
          pay = 50000


2) Write a function which computes a student's overall grade based on their score.
   That is, it takes a input a number between 0 and 100 and returns a grade based on
   the German grading system outlined below.

       Grade	Percentage
        1.0	    100-95.5
        1.3	    95.4 – 90.9
        1.7	    90.8 – 84.8
        2.0	    84.7 – 80.3
        2.3	    80.2 – 75.8
        2.7	    75.7 – 69.7
        3.0	    69.6 – 65.2
        3.3	    65.1 – 60.6
        3.7	    60.5 – 54.4
        4.0	    54.3 – 50
        5.0	     0   – 49.9


   Automated tests have been created in test_exercise_two.py and have been imported appropriately
   so you do not need to do anything extra to run them. They run automatically when you run
   main.py.
